## ERROR: Failed building wheel for hnswlib Failed to build hnswlib ERROR: Could not build wheels for hnswlib, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects

To Resolve this issue in Windows
You need to download https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ first.
Next, navigate to "Individual components", find these two MCVS v143 VS2022 C++ x64/86 latest
and Windows 10 SDK Windows 11 SDK latest

In the link you provided there is no option saying individual components. Where should I go to find it? Is it possible to give some concrete steps?

Thanks for providing an exact solution to this problem. the whole day I have invested to solve this problem by installing a multiple c++ package but when I installed the individual component as you have mentioned , this will help to fix the error
